### Research Experience
**MS Thesis Research @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln (_2020 – 2023_)**  
- Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences for human and non-human host adaptation
- Studied the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 interspecies transmission and pathogenesis
- Developed experimental design for analyzing and interpreting big data biological data to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different host
- Filtered poor sequence quality as a measure of data quality control
- Compared the host and viral protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction methods and predicted SARS-CoV-2 and host protein interactomes
- Used machine learning techniques like VirusHostPPI, LGCA-VHPPI, HVPPI, and LSTM-PHV to analyze PPI
- Collaborated with Dr. Luwen Zhang to study host and viral pathogenesis

**Undergraduate Research @ Southeast Missouri State University (_2017 – 2018_)**
- Putative Endophytic Bacterium from the Miller Reserve
- Aligned 16s rDNA sequences of bacteria obtained from the Miller Reserve
- Analyzed and compiled bacterial sequences using bioinformatics tools (Clustal Omega, BLAST, BioEdit, BankIt)

**Undergraduate Research @ LBEF Campus (_2013 – 2014_)**  
- Characterized Multi-Drug Resistance Pattern in Salmonella Paratyphi isolated from Hospital Samples by R- Plasmid Analysis and its Conjugative Transfer
