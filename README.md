### Research Experience
**MS Thesis Research @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln (_2020 – 2023_)**  
- Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences for human and non-human host adaptation
- Studied the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 interspecies transmission and pathogenesis
- Developed experimental design for analyzing and interpreting big data biological data to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different host
- Filtered poor sequence quality as a measure of data quality control
- Designed and developed a pipeline for data analysis using sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, BLAST, principal component analysis, and secondary structure prediction through high computing clusters
- Compared the host and viral protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction methods and predicted SARS-CoV-2 and host protein interactomes
- Used machine learning techniques like VirusHostPPI, LGCA-VHPPI, HVPPI, and LSTM-PHV to analyze PPI
- Collaborated with Dr. Luwen Zhang to study host and viral pathogenesis
- White-tailed deer (WTD) viral genomes were highly divergent
- WTD had higher variation in physicochemical properties than human viral proteins indicating rapid evolution of WTD viral proteins
- Van der Waals volume, residue volume, isoelectric point, steric parameter, molecular weight, and relative mutability contributed to determining the physicochemical properties
- Physicochemical properties contributing to the main variance were associated with the change in the hydrophobic nature of the viral proteins
- When the viral sequences of white-tailed deer were compared with the human variants, there were no significant effects in the protein-protein interaction prediction



**Undergraduate Research @ Southeast Missouri State University (_2017 – 2018_)**
- Putative Endophytic Bacterium from the Miller Reserve
- Aligned 16s rDNA sequences of bacteria obtained from the Miller Reserve
- Analyzed and compiled bacterial sequences using bioinformatics tools (Clustal Omega, BLAST, BioEdit, BankIt)
- Identified the new strains of Bacillus that were contributing to the restoration of the wetlands


**Undergraduate Research @ LBEF Campus (_2013 – 2014_)**  
- Characterized Multi-Drug Resistance Pattern in Salmonella Paratyphi isolated from Hospital Samples by R- Plasmid Analysis and its Conjugative Transfer
- Extracted the plant metabolites to check their microbiological properties
- Transferred R-plasmid from Salmonella Paratyphi showed a Multi-Drug Resistance Pattern
- Herbs like cumin, coriander, garlic, etc. showed significant sensitivity in Multi-Drug Resistance bacteria
